# portfolio_django
As part of my proffesinal development I have to understand that possesing a personal website 
is a great starting point for improvement. This project aims to serve as the container where 
I am going to store all of the files which will be used in my personal project.

If you wish to contribute to my project or used it for youself feel free to do so. I welcome 
any suggestion or changes which aims to better improve this website.

Thanks.
