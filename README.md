# portfolio_django
As part of my proffesinal development I have come to understand that possesing a personal website 
could be a great starting point for improvement. This project aims to serve as the container where 
I am going to store all of the files which will be used in my personal project.

If you wish to contribute to my project or used it for personal use plesae feel free to do so. I 
welcome any suggestion or changes which may aim to better improve this website.

Thanks.
